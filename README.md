This is my personal website and it talks about all my work  as i try to get into web development. It has 3 files html, css and javascript. 
The project is composed of 3 media querries with the focus being on mobile first. It has mobile, tablet and desktop which makes it a responsive website.
It's navigation menu expands and collapses depending on the screen sizes that the user is using. There is a humberger menu which displays the menu links whenever it's clicked.
The website also has a button which appears after the user scrolls 500px down the page so it could scroll the user back to the top if they want to go to the top.
