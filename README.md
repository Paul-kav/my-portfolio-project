This is my personal website that describes me and what project i have done as am trying to get into a web development carrier. It has 3 files html, css and javascript. 
The project is composed of 3 media querries with the focus being on mobile first. It has mobile, tablet and desktop which makes it a responsive website.
It's navigation expands and collapses depending on the screen sizes that the user is using.
The website also has a button which appears after the user scrolls 500px down the page so it could scroll to the top if they want to.
